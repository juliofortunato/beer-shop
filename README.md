_This is a simple PDP built using Next.js and TailwindCSS to be used as Minutentag's technical test. It works as a simulation so the user can check the prices for beers on different sizes_

## ‚Ñπ Requirements

- NodeJS (used v20.7.0 on development)
- NPM / Yarn

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

First of all, you'll need to install the project's dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

Rename the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` so we can use the ENV vars for the API

Then you can start the application using

```
npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Build

A production build can be generated with

```
npm run build
```

## üêõ Bugs and Known Issues

Since the challenge was regarding the PDP, some of the first page (the one with the product listing) features weren't implemented, such as the search and category filter.

Also, for that first page, since we don't know which SKU is being shown, I opted for displaying the product's first SKU price on the listing.
